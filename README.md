# Manga Printer

The tool that will let you print your manga/comics images in the best way

## The problem:

Downloading manga from the internet (**Legally of course, like from [MANGA Plus by SHUEISHA](https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/)**) can result in complex situations:

* You have some files with double panels and some with a single panel. But, simply cutting every double page into 2 files of singles will not work because:
    1. You need to consider whether the chapter is being read from right to left or vice versa. 
    2. Since the chapter was stripped from any advertisement pages in between, some doubles will be split across printed pages if not ordered correctly.
* At any point, you might give yourself a spoiler dealing with arranging and printing.

## The solution:

Here is where MangaPrinter comes to help. It will let you, among others, to:

* Manage both chapters, pages and binding in a single GUI
* Get double panels to stay together on any bindings
* Preview each step with blur built in to avoid spoilers!
* Add special pages such as a page at the start and end of each chapter with the chapter name
* Add RTL\LTR arrows and page numbers to make reading a breeze.
* Add anti-spoiler pages to help you when you cut or staple the printed pages
* Get fast overview of the files and get alerted on common issues
* Use many tools to solve common issues on manga files
* Export to PDF without any extra installs\tools!
* Run on Windows and Linux (with docker)
