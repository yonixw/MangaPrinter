# MangaPrinter

The tool that will let you print manga from the internet!

## The problem:

Downloading manga from the internet (**Legally of course, after supporting the creator**) can result in complex situations:
* You have some files with double pages and some contain singles. 
* Simply cutting every double page into 2 files of singles will not work because you need to consider whether the chapter is being read from right to left or vice versa. 
* Also, since the chapter was stripped from any advertisement pages in-between, some doubles will be split across printed pages if not treated correctly.

## The solution:

Here is where MangaPrinter comes to help. It will let you:

* Manage both chapters and pages
* Decide on the go whether a page is single or double
* Add a page in the start and end of each chapter 
* Auto manage everything so all double pages will stay together
* Add anti-spoiler pages to help you when you cut or staple the printed pages
* Preview each step with blur built in to avoid spoilers!
* Add RTL\LTR arrows and page numbers to make reading a breeze.
* Amazing GUI to choose ratio aspect of the double pages (width in px is problematic)
* Export to PDF without any extra installs\tools!
