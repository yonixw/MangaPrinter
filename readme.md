# MangaPrinter

The tool that will let you print manga from the internet!



## The problem:

Downloading manga from the internet can result in complex situations where you have some files with double pages and some contain singles. So, when you try to print those you will meet difficulties to manage it. 
Simply cutting every double page into 2 files of singles will not work because you need to consider whether the chapter is being read from right to left or vice versa. Also, since the chapter was stripped from any advertisement pages in-between, some doubles will be split across printed pages if not treated correctly.

## The solution:

Here is where MangaPrinter comes to help. It will let you:

* Manage chapters and pages
* Decide on the go whether a page is single or double
* Add a page in the start and end of each chapter 
* Auto manage everything so all double pages will stay together
* Add anti-spoiler pages to help you when you cut or staple the printed pages
* Preview each step with blur built in to avoid spoilers!
* Add RTL\LTR arrows and page numbers to make reading a breeze.
* Export to PDF without any extra installs!
